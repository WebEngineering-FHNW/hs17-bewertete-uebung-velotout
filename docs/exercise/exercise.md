Project idea short description:
I would like to implement a Grail application that will represent a library-system.
There will be Users, and Medias (Book, E-Book, Cd...) and the system will
allow User to borrow these medias.
Furthermore, each Book will be affected to a library (Place) 
User can borrow Book from differents library, for instance: FHNW Windisch, FHNW Olten...
In addition, I will implement highlighting for user that are too late with their Booking (if someone forget to give the media back...) 
So CRUD for User, Media, Library (Place)

Questions about it:
I thought, I will not implement a login function with password, everybody can have a look to others Booking and update the list. It's allowed?

Don't hesitate,if it's a bad idea i will do the socrative-light project;
 
## Project confirmation

confirmed.

Cool project. It is fully ok to go without authentication and other security features.
Just assume that users are identified before they even reach your system.
Concentrate on the library features. Start small. Extend from there. Always keep it running.
Good luck!
