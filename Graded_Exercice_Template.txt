Project idea short description:
I would like to implement a Grail application that will represent a library-system.
There will be Users, and Medias (Book, E-Book, Cd...) and the system will
allow User to borrow these medias.
Furthermore, each Book will be affected to a library (Place) 
User can borrow Book from differents library, for instance: FHNW Windisch, FHNW Olten...
In addition, I will implement highlighting for user that are too late with their Booking (if someone forget to give the media back...) 
So CRUD for User, Media, Library (Place)

Questions about it:
I thought, I will not implement a login function with password, everybody can have a look to others Booking and update the list. It's allowed?

Don't hesitate,if it's a bad idea i will do the socrative-light project;
